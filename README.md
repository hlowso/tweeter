# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

My version of tweeter includes the following stretch components: user login/registration (there are no passwords, so login and registration are almost the same thing), tweets of other users can be liked, tweets cannot be liked by the user who created them, the username in each tweet is the name of the user who made the tweet. Cookie session is used to obscure username cookies. Scss is compiled for styling.
